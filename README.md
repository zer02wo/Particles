## Description

A lightweight recreation of the [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) library using the *HTML5 canvas* element.

The files within this project are envisioned to be used within a hero or landing page, thus would be customised to the relevant organisation.

## Features

* Randomly generated particles
    * Size, velocity, opacity and colour all easily customisable within JavaScript

* Interconnective strength via distance between particles
    * Opacity/line width weakens as particles separate

* Smooth collision interaction with cursor 
    * Expand cursor radius by holding left click

* Animated morphing gradient background
    * Easily customisable with CSS
